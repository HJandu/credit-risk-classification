Module 20 Supervised Machine Learning Challenge

## Background
In this Challenge, I have used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I have used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

The following steps were used:

1. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

2. Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

3. Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data

4. Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
