## <ins>Overview of the Analysis</ins>

The purpose of the analysis was to use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
This model was used to determine which loans were healthy (low-risk) or non-healthy (high-risk) based on the loan status provided by the lending company.
The y variable in this analysis is the "loan status", which shows if a loan is low-risk (0) or at high-risk (1) and the X variable is the loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks and number of total debt. 

The stages of the machine learning process I went through as part of this analysis was as follows:
1. I split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split. 
2. Fitted a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).
3. Saved the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model.
4. Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance by doing the following:
  i) Calculated the accuracy score of the model.  
  ii) Generated a confusion matrix.
  iii) Printed the classification report.


5. Logistic Regression models were created by using the original data set and resampled training data set.  The results were later compared.

## <ins>Summary</ins>
The Logistic Regression model fitted with OverSampled data (model 2) performed a lot better than the model fitted with Imbalanced data due to the data being balanced and generating a higher accuracy score and a higher recall, indicating that the model will make extremely fewer mistakes when classifying non-healthy loans.

The balanced accuracy score is improved using the resampled (oversampling) process from 0.95 to 0.99. It is important to predict the high-risks (1), as lenders do not want to loan out money to those who will struggle to pay it back. In this case I would recommend using model 2.
